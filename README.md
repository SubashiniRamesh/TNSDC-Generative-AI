Introduction

In today's digital world, analyzing demographic data from images has become increasingly important. This project provides a solution for predicting the gender and approximate age of individuals from their photos. 
Leveraging the power of deep learning, specifically using Keras with TensorFlow backend, the program is capable of analyzing patterns in images to make predictions.

Dataset Information

UTKFace dataset is a large-scale face dataset with long age span (range from 0 to 116 years old). The dataset consists of over 20,000 face images with annotations of age, gender, and ethnicity. 
The images cover large variation in pose, facial expression, illumination, occlusion, resolution, etc. This dataset could be used on a variety of tasks, e.g., face detection, age estimation, age progression/regression,
landmark localization, etc.The objective of the project is to detect gender and age using facial images. Convolutional Neural Network is used to classify the images.
There are 2 output types namely, gender(M or F) and age.
